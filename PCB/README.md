# PCB Teardown

The ods spreadsheet documents all the components on the board with measured values for passives. The designators are sometimes arbitrary and are only guaranteed to match with the designators layer in the xcf.

## Attempt 1
All components were removed by careless application of a hot plate and quickly tapping the board on a table. Copper and dielectric was removed by hand with 320 or 600 grit sandpaper. This didn't take as long as it sounds but the hot plate did some internal damage and it was difficult to evenly work through all the copper of a layer without going in to the dielectric between the next layer. Images were captured with a Pixel 3. The results were promising but not quite good enough.

## Attempt 2
All components were removed by hand with tweezers and careful application of a hot plate. Copper was removed by etching with a cupric chloride solution, dielectric was removed with 600 grit sandpaper. Images were captured with a flatbed scanner. This worked really well, you can even clearly see every HDI via in the dielectric layers after the copper is etched off.

Open the big xcf for all the high-res goodness.
